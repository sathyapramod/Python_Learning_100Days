# Python_Learning_ZTM

This repository contains my learning journey through the Zero to Mastery (ZTM) Python course.  
It includes practice exercises, coding challenges, mini-projects, and notes as I build a strong foundation in Python.

## Contents
- 🔹 Basics of Python (syntax, variables, data types, functions)
- 🔹 Object-Oriented Programming
- 🔹 Error handling & debugging
- 🔹 Working with files & modules
- 🔹 Python libraries and frameworks
- 🔹 Final projects and hands-on applications

The goal of this repo is to track progress, reinforce concepts, and create a reference for future Python projects.
